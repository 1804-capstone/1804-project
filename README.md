Social contract:
- Morning and afternoon stand ups, as well as as needed --> 5 min or less
- code reviews as needed
- even if a feature seems really simple, go over it with everyone to get a verbal yes for decisions
- not take things personally, it's an intense process
- github: keeping track of what issues are posted, making sure the project board is reflecting what we're working on
	+ collectively write the first issues that are bigger and later on work on minor details
	+ notifying everyone when PRs happen
- Don't apologize! Unless you should.
